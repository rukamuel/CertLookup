> This project has been **abandoned** and is no longer maintained. It has been replaced by a new and improved **[SSL Client](https://github.com/rukamuel/ssl-client)**.

## What's New?
The new **SSL Client** comes with advanced features for X.509 certificate lookup and validation. It offers:
- Support for modern PHP versions
- Improved performance
- Enhanced certificate validation and error reporting

## Migration Guide
If you were using the old project, I highly recommend switching to the new [SSL Client](https://github.com/rukamuel/ssl-client). For installation instructions and advanced usage, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/rukamuel/ssl-client#readme).

See [example.php](https://github.com/rukamuel/ssl-client/blob/main/example.php) for advanced usage scenarios.

## Installation
You can install the new client using Composer:

```bash
composer require rukamuel/ssl-client "^1.0"
```
